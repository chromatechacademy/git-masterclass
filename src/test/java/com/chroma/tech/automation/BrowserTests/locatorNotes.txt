LOCATORS

- Currently as of June, 2022 Selenium WebDriver offers 8 different ways to locate 
Web Page elements (HTML Elements)

- In order to perform any action on an element, such as sending text, clicking, etc, 
we need to locate an element to interact with

- A locator can also be referenced as the address to an element

Locators:
1. className
2. cssSelector
3. ID
4. linkText
5. name
6. partialLinkText
7. tagName
8. xpath
